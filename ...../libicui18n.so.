./vertcoin-ocm: error while loading shared libraries: libicui18n.so.68: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

GUI does not start.

One Click Miner vNext 2.0 Final

Manjaro KDE.

Issue is caused by latest update of package icu 69.1-1 (and relevant libraries as above, all with version 69)

It's impossible (or at least I didn't manage) to rollback to a previous version, given that icu is dependency of raptor, which is a dependency of hundreds of kde/qt packages.

I tried to build the miner from source but I couldn't find where to edit this dependency

There is nothing in debug.log, program doesn't start.

Similar issue: GUI won't start when using latest GTK, which can be rolled back with:

sudo pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/webkit2gtk-2.30.5-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
